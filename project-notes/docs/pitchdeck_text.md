REWALL is a DIGITAL PLATFORM aiming to
create a unique RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE
within the European research region, with the
potential of expanding globally.REWALL
WHAT? Rewall is a digital platform for research and knowledge. The platform is a hybrid of a high-tech search engine and a social media
platform.
WHO? Rewall is part of startup Humarena – founded by M.A. historians Karin Hellqvist and Makrina Hjälm Ellnemyr. Backed by experienced
startup founder Felix Pettersson, senior researcher Miriam Lindgren Hjälm, senior at EY Xenia Ellnemyr, sustainability coordinator
Beobjin Yoon, CEO at Geoveta Eva Rönnberg, and corporate lawyer Rafael Paladino.
WHY?
In 2024 research within the EU was amounting to approximately €403 billion. Not enough of the research produced is communicated
to the public and is therefore not contributing to the economic ecosystem. Rewall strive to create a research infrastructure that will
be the foundation for a socially sustainable society. The aim is also to limit the spread of misinformation and disinformation in
society, primarily among men.
HOW? We are a startup focused on disrupting an industry and starting a new one – through strong marketing and first class technology.
We will use AI and modern algorithms to target our users. Our AI-tools will summarize the research articles to be more accessible. By
doing so, Rewall will limit the use of the world's resources by not allowing the users to get a personal summary for every search.
SUMMARYREWALL
EU SPENT €403.1 BILLION
ON RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT IN 2024
In 2024, the EU spent an estimated €403.1 billion on research &
development (R&D), indicating a 3.6% increase from 2023
(€389.2 billion). Compared with 2014, R&D expenditure grew by
62.2% from €248.6 billion, showing a steady rise in the last
decade.REWALL
Rewall strive to create a research infrastructure
that will be the foundation for a socially
sustainable society.

EU’s goal is for 3% of EU’s GDP to go to R&D.
SWEDEN 45–50 universities and university colleges
GERMANY Over 1,000 publicly funded research institutions
FRANCE Around 70 universities, over 1,100 laboratories

EU RESEARCHREWALL
High-income regions (including EU) publish 1.5–1.7 million research articles annually, EU is responsible for
approximately 12% of the world’s research output.
To men between 20-60. Men who are
interested in understanding the world. Men
who want to receive and share information.
Men who crave easy accessible knowledge
on the go.
“Specifically, while women are mainly driven by relational uses, (...),
men base their continuance intentions on their ability to gain
information of a general nature.”
Hanna Krasnova, Natasha F. Veltri, Nicole Eling, Peter Buxmann, 2017
We are selling a lifestyle of
INTELLIGENCE, QUALITY, and
HERITAGE.REWALL
WHY MEN?
Findings in recent research has shown that men tend to rely more on accidental
information exposure without checking multiple sources. Women on the other hand
are more likely to be cautious about the quality of information they encounter. The fact
that the association between passive information-gathering and misinformation is so
strong with men suggests that targeting interventions based on gender differences is
needed.REWALL
REWALLTHERE ARE 219 MILLION
MEN IN EU-27 BETWEEN
20–60 YEAR OLD.
Our primary target customers are European men between 20–60
years who are using digital platforms on a daily basis. In broad
numbers it is around 219 million men in EU-27 who are 20–60
years old. In the beginning Rewall will focus on men in the Nordic
and Baltic countries, which will limit the target customers, but
there are approximately 9 million men between 20–60 years in
the Nordic and Baltic countries.
