# Future Ideas & Features

## 1. Dual Histogram for Spectrum Questions

**Status:** Idea (not implemented)

When showing a spectrum question like "Is the Western view of China biased?", display **two overlapping histograms**:

- **Community opinions** (user votes/positions)
- **Research paper positions** (where papers fall on the spectrum)

This allows users to compare: "Most people think X, but research suggests Y"

## 2. Topic Hashtags System

**Status:** Partially implemented

Every topic = a hashtag page.
For posts and papers, show **related topics** as hashtag pills.

## 3. Feed Ratio Target

**Goal:** 2/3 floating content, 1/3 card content

Floating = everyday social feed (posts, discussions, comments, network activity)
Cards = special discovery content (new papers, spectrum questions, trending, recommendations)
